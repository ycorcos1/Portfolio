export const Abstract =
  "As a recent Computer Science graduate, I have spent my time learning as much as I can about programming. I learned the fundamentals of computer science, such as data structures, algorithms, and architecture, as well as honing my Java and C++ skills. During my college career, I took courses such as Internet and Web technologies, Cloud Computing, and database systems. These courses taught me how to interact with web APIs, the fundamentals of cloud computing, how to create, modify and use databases using MySQL. Outside of school, I continued to look for ways to develop my programming skills and through public resources, I learned how to build websites using React. I furthered my knowledge of AWS and received my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification in September 2023. I am very passionate and motivated to grow and develop in the tech industry and contribute in a professional setting.";
