export const Abstract = [
  "I am a software developer with a Computer Science degree from Queens College, where I built a strong foundation in programming fundamentals, data structures, and algorithms. My academic background and hands-on experience have enabled me to work across full-stack development, cloud computing, and database management while continuously expanding my technical expertise.",
  "During my junior year, I interned at Alternative Vision Capital, where I helped develop and migrate databases to AWS Cloud, improving data management and real estate opportunity identification. This experience strengthened my skills in SQL, AWS (RDS, EC2, S3), and backend development.",
  "After graduating, I joined PS Medical Systems, contributing to the development of eWebStaffing, a back-office management system for medical staffing agencies. I built tools for staff credential management, payroll processing, and scheduling automation, gaining expertise in React, Node.js, RESTful APIs, authentication (JWT), and UI/UX design.",
  "Outside of work, I develop projects that enhance my technical skills. I built and deployed my portfolio website using AWS services and created LiveBall, a Chrome extension that fetches real-time NBA scores, deepening my experience in API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, and cloud deployment.",
  "I am passionate about software architecture, building scalable applications, and leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. I continuously seek opportunities to apply my full-stack development expertise in a dynamic and innovative environment.",
